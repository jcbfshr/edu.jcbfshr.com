The North-South divide is stark, yet the line seems impalpable to most everyone. Part of the reason for this is that the changes between the &ldquo;north&rdquo; and the &ldquo;south&rdquo; occur gradually — despite many trying to clearly define a line similar to Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall. <strong>For example, around ¼ of people living in the Midlands say they consider themselves Northern, and only around 7.5% saying they consider themselves Southern. Despite this, during the Great Depression in the 1930s, while the North suffered horrendously, the Midlands prospered like the South of England. Thus, economically, the Midlands may be closer to the North, but socially, the Southern identity gradually fades as the Northern identity creeps in.</strong>
What is clear, though, is that spending is unjustly different: in London, transport infrastructure spending stood at £2,500 per capita, whereas in the North East, that figure was £5 per capita. Furthermore, almost every government has an aim to address the divide &ndash; and every attempt coming to almost nothing. Because of the centralisation in this country, 95p of every £1 in tax goes to Whitehall and then is reallocated to local councils.
If this country could de-centralise, as is sought almost universally on the internet, perhaps the persona of the &lsquo;neglected Northeners&rsquo; might perish. The mortality rates in Blackpool and Hull are worse than parts of Turkey, Slovakia and Romania; The Economist describes the North as &ldquo;poor as Alabama&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s important in decentralising is that people can tackle the issues they understand, without the upper class politicians telling people living in poverty about the problems they believe need to be fixed.</p>
