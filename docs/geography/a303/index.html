                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>In 2017, Theresa May&rsquo;s government announced plans to build a tunnel, at least 3.2km long, underneath Stonehenge, but 50m further away from the monument, although the first mention of a tunnel under Stonehenge came in 1995. This plan is a result of the £15 billion road improvement plan that Cameron&rsquo;s government announced in 2014, under which the A303 was flagged requiring improvements. Prime Minister David Cameron said the road &ldquo;held parts of the country back&rdquo;. The road improvement scheme was reiterated in the 2020 budget.</p>
<p>The problem stems from the lack of a motorway bridging the M3 and the M5, from Basingstoke to Taunton / Exeter. The only major road is the A303, forking into the A358 and A30, respectively. Around 56km of this corridor is a single carriageway, not only seriously augmenting journey times, but also increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Of the 18 million British people that holiday in the region, 29% come from the South East, and 85% will travel by car (Highways England). This, in turn, is harming the South West&rsquo;s economy for trade; merchants advise against making shippings along the road on Friday because of the wasted time spent sitting in traffic. The vast amount of tourists that come for the picturesque setting drive a lot of the trade in the region. It has the highest domestic tourism expenditure of any region in the UK at £4.5bn.</p>
<p>The current speed limit ranges from 70-50mph; Highways England says they aim to create average speeds of 60mph. The majority of traffic disruption comes from the single carriageway around Stonehenge — thus one of their aims are to upgrade all of the single carriageway stretches into dual carriageways, costing anywhere from £100-250 million. They say that 24,000 vehicles use the single carriageway section every day, twice their designated capacity. A 2013 study claims that these upgrades could prevent an average of 30 personal injury accidents annually. DSFRVS reports an accident on the A303 every six days.</p>
<p>The Highways England report also claims that with freer-flowing traffic, motorists won&rsquo;t need to divert to side roads in avoiding congestion; thus allowing smaller villages to &ldquo;regain their heart[s]&rdquo;. The government website claims the scheme will create 100,000 new homes and 120,000 extra jobs.</p>
<p>Although plans were delayed in July 2020 due to archaeological finds of more than 20 Neolithic rings, the £1.7 billion tunnel was approved by the transport secretary in November of that year. Further discoveries are still being made, with the Guardian reporting on 4 February 2021 that Bronze age graves and neolithic pottery  had been discovered at the site. Highways England says that the finds were at least 500m away from the planned upgrade, &ldquo;well outside the scheme boundary&rdquo;. Lots of people believe the tunnel would disturb local archaeology and cite visual pollution for their &ldquo;anti-tunnel&rdquo; campaigns. The Planning Inspectorate said the tunnel would cause &ldquo;permanent, irreversible harm&rdquo; to the site, alongside UNESCO, who designate it a World Heritage Site. Nevertheless, the Department for Transport wrote to Highways England stating: &ldquo;The Secretary of State is satisfied that, on balance, the need case for the development together with the other benefits identified outweigh any harm&rdquo;. Some would argue, including English Heritage, that the current A303 position is more visually polluting than a tunnel would be. Indeed, also, it would emit much less auditory pollution to the visitors. Right now, the A303 bisects the World Heritage Site, but removing the surface road would allow visitors to walk freely across the whole site. Construction is finally thought to begin in 2023, following its 2021 start date published in the original 2017 document.</p>
