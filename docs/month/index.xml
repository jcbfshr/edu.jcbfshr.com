          <description>differing teaching attitudes differing attitudes from the children differing attitudes to education difference between surroundings and the school  In Source A, the attitudes to education are open, with a lot of emphasis on creativity. This can be inferred from the fact that “children’s painting[s] and poems […] covered every available space”, suggesting that the school embraced the children’s creativity. However, in the second source, the teacher remarks the schoolgirls are “boxing most viciously”, showing that the school is a place of violence rather than education.</description>

          <description>q. i) Write an account of how the Battle of Verdun became a crisis for both sides during 1916 (8 marks)
The Battle of Verdun became a crisis for the French as they had lost Fort Douaumont and their defensive positions at the start of the battle. Because it was seen as “the most well-defended city in France”, the French were reuluctant to give it up, despite it having no major, strategic position.</description>

          <description>Simon is, perhaps, the only character in the novel to symbolise Golding’s piety following the horrors he faced during his time serving in the British Navy. Monteith cut almost references and symbolism of religion out of the original draft, being an agnostic himself. In the beginning of the book, Simon reaches up into the trees to feed the desperate littluns' hands below, ensuring they get “double handfuls”. Simon is, in this passage, physically higher than the greedy littluns, almost suggesting he is metaphorically higher, too.</description>

          <description>The Germans had not launched a major offensive on the Western Front since November 1914. Thus enter Verdun: the longest, and amongst the bloodiest of The First World War, which ultimately saw Germany’s own plan massively backfire, whilst the Russian war machine was now in full swing, the British and French began an offensive at the Somme (involving the first ever use of tanks), and the Romanians (following two years of neutrality) sided with the Triple Entente.</description>
