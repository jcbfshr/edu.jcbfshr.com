<ul>
<li>Haig&rsquo;s goal was to break out of the positions at Ypres, overlooked by the Germans — pushing towards the Belgian coast (where some U-Boat stations were) and draw them away from the suffering French army
<ul>
<li>British did control most of the high ground by the end of the battle</li>
<li>French army had used its crucial opportunity to recover</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Haig gave command to Gough (who had risen from commanding a brigade to the 5th Army in two years) instead of Plumer, who had successfully launched an offensive at Messines Ridge just before Passchendaele using a bite-and-hold approach
<ul>
<li>25 August 1917 — Haig gives command to Plumer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commenced 31 July 1917 at 03:50</li>
<li>Gough changed the plans so that forces would attempt to capture the third and fourth German defensive lines, as opposed to the original plan to take two lines</li>
<li>Almost equal amount of staggering casualties on both sides
<ul>
<li>Germans suffer 250,000</li>
<li>Allied suffer 260,000</li>
<li>&ldquo;Blindest battle of a blind war&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="allied-strengths-at-passchendaele">Allied strengths at Passchendaele</h1>
<ul>
<li>Drew German forces away from French forces that could have been wiped out of the war given their near-munity on the Nivelle Offensive</li>
<li>Heavy casualties ****— but not nearly as many as at the Somme; captured much more territory than at the Somme — shows evidence of learning curve</li>
<li>Supported by creeping barrage because of advancements in artillery technology — evidence of continuation of learning curve since Vimy Ridge</li>
<li>Plumer successfully introduced bite-and-hold tactics on 20 September 1917 at the Battle of Menin Road over a few hours, wading off the German counter-attacks
<ul>
<li>Soldiers would advance a very short distance (around 1500m) supported by heavy artillery, would then dig in and repel German counter-attacks, without becoming spread too thin (which accounted for the success of the German defence in depth tactics)</li>
<li>Unlike Gough, he took weeks to prepare and asked for many guns in advance</li>
<li>Australians, New Zealanders and Britons successfully attack German strongpoint on 26 September 1917 at Battle of Polygon Wood, and were waiting for Germans when they tried to counter-attack
<ul>
<li>This shows that Plumer had successfully turned the Germans' own defence in depth tactic against them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bite-and-hold tactics yet again deployed with a surprise attack at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917 whilst the Germans were preparing their own counter-attack. This prompted severe morale drops among the German 4th Army. British finally capture the Gheluvelt Plateau</li>
<li>In the final week of October 1917, Canadians launched a series of focused attacks which captured key targets around Passchendaele</li>
<li>On 6 November, in less than three hours, the Allies secured the village of Passchendaele</li>
<li>Germany had suffered huge manpower losses
<ul>
<li>This meant they could no longer afford to be drawn into such attritional warfare</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="allied-limitations-at-passchendaele">Allied limitations at Passchendaele</h1>
<ul>
<li>Germans had well defended the Ypres Salient since the Somme in 1916, when the battle was originally planned to go ahead</li>
<li>Germans had introduced &ldquo;defence in depth&rdquo; over the winter of 1916-17 instead of relying on a heavily-defended front-line
<ul>
<li>This tactic seeks to delay rather than prevent attacks</li>
<li>Relies on the attacker losing momentum over time as it covers a wider area</li>
<li>Pillboxes lined the German front, with infrantry ready to counter-attack once the attackers had lost momentum and advanced as far as they could from their frontline</li>
<li>The Germans could be easily forewarned by an attack due to the massive artillery bombardments that usually preceded them</li>
<li>Gough did not achieve the advances he was looking for, and German defence in depth tactic wreaked havoc across the attacking line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weather not ideal — large amounts of rainfall (unusually persistent and unseasonal) turned the battlefield to mud, which was churned up by the artillery bombardment
<ul>
<li>This slowed advancing troops down, leading to them falling behind the creeping barrage</li>
<li>Most of the British tanks got bogged down</li>
<li>Resulted in action being suspended until 10 August 1917
<ul>
<li>On 10 August, fierce German counter-attacks inflicted many casualties on allied forces, and the British only held the village of Westhoek — pattern continues with Battle of Langemarck (16-18 August 1917), although the French did capture Langemarck (not on crucial high ground)
<ul>
<li>British could not take the Gheluvelt Plateau off the German forces, leading to plumetting morale</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soldiers constantly had to be rotated because of the exhausting morass</li>
<li>Artillery guns failed to find stable ground due to mud</li>
<li>Heavy rainfall fell again, starting 3 October 1917 after success at Battle of Brooseind
<ul>
<li>Haig opted for one last push towards Passchendaele — at the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October 1917), conditions were awful; very little progress made. Most of the British artillery was out of action because of the rain, mud and German artillery fire</li>
<li>On 12 October 1917 (First Battle of Passchendaele), attackers found that barbed wire had not been cut — evidence against learning curve. Huge casualties felt by the Allies, with bad weather conditions meaning most of the injured could not be recovered or drowned in the mud before help could arrive. Decisive victory for Germany, despite all other previous Allied victories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Haig sent an officer to survey after the battle, he said, &ldquo;My God, did we really send men to fight in that?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>British soldiers would advance without flanking support or sufficient preparation (creating breaks in the supply chain during the constant rainfall) — commanders were taking constant gambles; trying their luck with different permutations.</li>
