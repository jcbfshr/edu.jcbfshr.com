                <p>q. i) Write an account of how the Battle of Verdun became a crisis for both sides
during 1916 (8 marks)</p>
<p>The Battle of Verdun became a crisis for the French as they had lost Fort Douaumont and their defensive positions at the start of the battle. Because it was seen as &ldquo;the most well-defended city in France&rdquo;, the French were reuluctant to give it up, despite it having no major, strategic position. This allowed the Germans to use it as a meat-grinder, with Falkenhayn keeping the high ground, and the French feeding in more troops.This led to extroadinary losses for the French, with around 150,000 dead. Equally, it became a crisis for the Germans as they fatally underestimated the French &ldquo;cult of the offensive&rdquo;, in which the Pétain decided, since they had to attack, they would try to inflict more casualties for Germany than for themselves. Although this didn&rsquo;t happen, around 135,000 Germans were killed — however Falkenhayn had initally predited 5:2 French to German losses, seriously hampering German efforts. Neither side could sustain these kinds of losses, leading British and French forces to launch an offensive at the Somme to relieve pressure at Verdun, which would finally stop the German war machine. Verdun was the last major offensive the Germans ever launched on the Western Front besides their last-ditch Spring Offensive effort.</p>
<p>The battle also became a crisis for  Germany as Falkenhayn&rsquo;s only aim was to kill as many as possible. The Crown Prince wanted to advance, but was orderd by Falkenhayn to retain a defensive position. However, Pétain was determined with the cult of the offensive, and subsequently widened the artery into Verdun: the &ldquo;Sacred Way&rdquo;. Prior to this, all horse-drawn and foot traffic was ordered to stay off the road, leaving it open for motor traffic. After the widening, one truck passed it every 14 seconds. This also allowed Pétain to put all the soldiers serving at the front on a rota system, to try and mitigate the physchological effects of the battle. Despite this, French soldiers were still reeling from the harrowing effects of shellshock. By December 1916, each side had fired around 10,000,000 shells each, or about 1.5Tg of explosive material. This turned the clayey ground and debris below them to become almost fluid, leading many French soldiers to refuse to fight, which devolved into a crisis for the French.</p>
<p>q. ii) How useful are Sources B and C to a historian studying the Battle of the
Somme? Explain your answer (12 marks)</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/source-B-Somme.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Source B is useful as it demonstrates the attitudes of the British press at the time. It shows an overwhelmed German line, with many Germans surrendering or dead. Also, their trenches are very shallow and do not look defensive, more like a makeshift machine gun dugout. It also shows a large amount of British soldiers that have made it to the German frontline who look professional and very willing to fight. In reality, the Germans had dug very deep, well defended trenches — this is one of the reasons why the huge artillery barrage prior to the Somme did not kill as many Germans as the Allies had hoped. Most of the time, German machine guns could mow down the British before they arrived at German frontlines, and the Germans could hide in dugouts whilst the barrages were taking place, coming out when they were finished just as the British exited their trenches. This will be why around 650,000 Allied casualties were recorded at the Somme. The source comes from a British newspaper. In Britain, under Asquith&rsquo;s government, the government enacted a clause which essentially allowed the government to restrict free press, and stop the publication of works which would affect the war effort. They also had the responsibility of their own country on their hands. The Great War, originally, was planned to be over by the winter of 1914. By this time, it had already been raging on for two years, and morale was quickly dwindling, alongside the fact the original, elite BEF had almost entirely been wiped out. So much so that the British had to mandate conscription, leaving the British army that was not interesting in fighting, but rather interested in staying alive. Therefore, it would have been in the newspaper&rsquo;s best interest to portray an image of successful British soldiers, not soldiers being mowed down by an ill-timed creeping barrage and machine gun fire.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/source-C-Somme.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Source C is useful as it supports the idea that the soldiers of the Somme were &ldquo;lions led by donkeys&rdquo;, insomuch as the captains could clearly see the assualt was not going to succeed, yet high command insisted upon it anyway. It also promotes the idea that the artillery did not do an effective job in cutting the barbed wire, which is largely true because the British had put a rush on the production of artillery shells, with many (up to 50%) being dud. Because this was not a public source, it can also be seen as reliable, as it would not have been edited for the sake of propaganda, as it was created for the military, and as such would have little reason to exaggerate or underplay the facts. Equally, though, a lot of the time, punishment for desertion or unwillingness to fight would have been death, and as such it would be in the military&rsquo;s interest to portray the facts in high command&rsquo;s favour, and nullify the soldiers' testimonies, to permit a punishment; ergo this source is not completely impartial. Although it accuses the officers of &ldquo;lacking courage&rdquo; despite their better judgement, it can still be seen as useful as it tells us that British high command may have been ignorant. This source was also written in July 1916, at the height of the Somme, when the learning curve had not yet kicked in, but also after the elites in the army had been wiped out, so it shows that the British would be more likely to pursue court-martials to instill order and a willingness to fight in their conscript army.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that Source C is the most useful source, as it evidences, first-hand, a lot of the beliefs about the ineffectiveness of the artillery programme before the Somme, and also how British commanders were displeased with the outcomes at the Somme, as they had to penalise their officers on the first day of the assault. Unlike Source B, it probably hasn&rsquo;t been edited to the same degree to make it suitable for the public eye, and wouldn&rsquo;t have been released during wartime, so the accuracy of the soldiers' testimonies is most likely unaltered..</p>
