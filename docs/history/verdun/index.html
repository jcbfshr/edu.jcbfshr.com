                <p><strong>The Germans had not launched a major offensive on the Western Front since November 1914. Thus enter Verdun: the longest, and amongst the bloodiest of The First World War, which ultimately saw Germany&rsquo;s own plan massively backfire, whilst the Russian war machine was now in full swing, the British and French began an offensive at the Somme (involving the first ever use of tanks), and the Romanians (following two years of neutrality) sided with the Triple Entente.</strong></p>
<h1 id="german-aims">German aims</h1>
<p>German aims were simple: inflict major casualties for the French, whilst incurring few themselves. The crucial part of this plan was insomuch as that was the <strong>only</strong> aim. There weren&rsquo;t any territorial plans &ndash; quite to the contrary, Erich von Falkenhayn, then Chief of German General Staff, insisted that Verdun be used as a human meat-grinder. Verdun was a great source of national pride for the French; Fort Douaumont was the largest fort in the world. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870 had left the French humiliated, and sparked the construction of the fort. It was seen as the most-defended city in France, seen with similar naïvety to the perception of RMS Titanic&rsquo;s &ldquo;unsinkability&rdquo; in 1912.</p>
<p>This is, primarily, what Falkenhayn saw; he aimed to exploit this with a means to ending the war through a brutal, bloody plan &ndash; that of killing for killing&rsquo;s sake, constantly provoking the French to attack. Falkenhayn acknowledged that the war would no longer end in a breakthrough &ndash; but the subtle wearing down of the French, breaking morale and waging war through attrition. He knew the French would not give up Verdun, despite it&rsquo;s almost town-like size, and having very little strategical purpose. He saw the opportunity to attack from all sides; feeding in more and more soldiers until the French sought peace &ndash; which the French never did. If the Germans could just get one side of the Entente to surrender, the coalition would be undeniably undermined. Fundamentally, this plan cuts right through to all that is criticised about war: an unjustifiable, staggering loss of human life for, what both sides knew would be, the sake of having a bloodbath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The string in France has reached breaking point. A mass breakthrough—which in any case is beyond our means—is unnecessary. Within our reach there are objectives for the retention of which the French General Staff would be compelled to throw in every man they have. If they do so <strong>the forces of France will bleed to death.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>- <em>Erich von Falkenhayn. To the Kaiser, 1915.</em></p>
<p>Falkenhayn wanted to limit German casualties, and resolved the best way to do this would be through a constant barrage of artillery fire. On the very first day of fighting, the Germans shot over two million shells at the French lines. This would grow to be orders of magnitude more in the months that followed.</p>

<p>- Fig. 1</p>
<p>One of Germany&rsquo;s greatest flaws in the battle was the underestimation of the French. Of course, the French weren&rsquo;t going to surrender Verdun &ndash; making it easy to turn into a meat-grinder, but equally, that stubbornness would not translate to capitulation. The humiliation of the War of 1870 was still rippling through France, and was a key factor in the start of the First World War. For the French, the only justification for the huge sacrifices made in lives would be victory. The Germans reported 5:2 losses, which, as can be seen in Fig. 1, was far from the truth. Falkenhayn reported in May that French losses amounted to around 525,000 men, whereas, in reality, it was closer to 130,000. The actual ratio of French to German losses stood closer to 11:10, meaning Falkenhayn&rsquo;s estimations were out by 127.2%. Despite Germany having the initial upper-hand at Verdun, things only went downhill thereafter.</p>
<p>The Germans fatally underestimated the French &ldquo;cult of the offensive&rdquo; &ndash; as described below, the cult of the offensive ideology stated that in receiving casualties, the French would try their best to reciprocate them for the Germans.</p>
<h1 id="devolution-to-crises-for-both-sides">Devolution to crises for both sides</h1>
<h2 id="for-germany">For Germany</h2>
<p>Germany had overestimated just how many casualties it could inflict without incurring any. This was what the French had acknowledged right at the start of the battle, leading Pétain to divert the majority of the French Army divisions to Verdun; if the Germans were going to cause major losses for the French, Pétain would make sure the same was true for the Germans. This was evidenced when Pétain began expanding the &ldquo;Sacred Way&rdquo;, moving huge amounts of soldiers and ammunition into Verdun. Pétain set up a rota system, to try and combat the effects of shellshock &ndash; this resulted in the French troops spending much less time on the frontline than the German soldiers.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for this battle going wrong for the Germans was the aims of Falkenhayn and the Crown Prince, commanding the Fifth Army. Falkenhayn wanted to hold high ground for a constant artillery barrage, whilst the Crown Prince saw opportunity to advance and land a decisive capture of Verdun. This difference of opinions significantly drove up the death toll, and the ambiguity in this plan was left to corps headquarters to sort out.</p>
<p>It had become very clear by July that victory for Germany was no longer in plain sight. On 12 July, Falkenhayn ordered a strict defensive policy, only allowing offensives to limit French transfers to the Somme &ndash; underscoring the impact of the Anglo-French offensive on what the Germans assumed would begin the collapse of the Entente. Germany began fighting on all fronts against all its enemies, and thus the Verdun killing-machine quickly grew out of favour amongst High Command. On 29 August, Falkenhayn would be sacked and replaced by Hindenburg, who promptly ended the Verdun assault days later. Attrition warfare consumed too many troops, and prolonged the war.</p>
<h2 id="for-france">For France</h2>
<p>The French were fighting for a position which, fundamentally, had no military significance. It was primarily sentimental &ndash; having spent decades building the largest fort in the world and its branding as the most-defended city in France. They had, however, removed almost all the guns from the forts in 1915 &ndash; as their role in the war was laughable at best. Even the soldiers manning the crews had left, leaving only middle-aged maintenance crews from the French Home Guard. They promptly surrendered when the 5th Army investigated why the fort was not shooting at them, sending in a raiding party. Joseph Joffre, general for the Western Front before Pétain, repeatedly argued than any attack on Verdun would be a diversion, and thus defences were not prioritised there. This practically allowed the Germans the element of surprise, move thousands of guns and laying hundreds of kilometres of telephone wire through the forest without the French noticing, until the rain bogged them down.</p>
<p>Despite Pétain&rsquo;s best efforts, the psychological effects on the soldiers were still very harsh. French Lieutenant Alfred Joubaire famously wrote in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is mad. It must be mad to do what it is doing. What a massacre! What scenes of horror and carnage! I cannot find words to translate my impressions. Hell cannot be so terrible. Men are mad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- Alfred Joubaire, 21 (in description of the battle), before being killed by a German artillery shell</em></p>
<p>The constant artillery fire from both sides devastated the land, resulting in truly miserable conditions &ndash; for both sides. Combined with the rain, the clay turned to a wasteland of something resembling the aftermath of a mudslide &ndash; fluid mud and debris. Many French soldiers experienced serious cases of shellshock and insanity. Soon, soldiers would begin refusing to fight.</p>
