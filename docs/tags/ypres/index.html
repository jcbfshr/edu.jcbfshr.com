    <p>Notes  Haig&rsquo;s goal was to break out of the positions at Ypres, overlooked by the Germans — pushing towards the Belgian coast (where some U-Boat stations were) and draw them away from the suffering French army  British did control most of the high ground by the end of the battle French army had used its crucial opportunity to recover   Haig gave command to Gough (who had risen from commanding a brigade to the 5th Army in two years) instead of Plumer, who had successfully launched an offensive at Messines Ridge just before Passchendaele using a bite-and-hold approach  25 August 1917 — Haig gives command to Plumer   Commenced 31 July 1917 at 03:50 Gough changed the plans so that forces would attempt to capture the third and fourth German defensive lines, as opposed to the original plan to take two lines Almost equal amount of staggering casualties on both sides  Germans suffer 250,000 Allied suffer 260,000 &ldquo;Blindest battle of a blind war&rdquo;    Allied strengths at Passchendaele  Drew German forces away from French forces that could have been wiped out of the war given their near-munity on the Nivelle Offensive Heavy casualties ****— but not nearly as many as at the Somme; captured much more territory than at the Somme — shows evidence of learning curve Supported by creeping barrage because of advancements in artillery technology — evidence of continuation of learning curve since Vimy Ridge Plumer successfully introduced bite-and-hold tactics on 20 September 1917 at the Battle of Menin Road over a few hours, wading off the German counter-attacks  Soldiers would advance a very short distance (around 1500m) supported by heavy artillery, would then dig in and repel German counter-attacks, without becoming spread too thin (which accounted for the success of the German defence in depth tactics) Unlike Gough, he took weeks to prepare and asked for many guns in advance Australians, New Zealanders and Britons successfully attack German strongpoint on 26 September 1917 at Battle of Polygon Wood, and were waiting for Germans when they tried to counter-attack  This shows that Plumer had successfully turned the Germans' own defence in depth tactic against them     Bite-and-hold tactics yet again deployed with a surprise attack at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917 whilst the Germans were preparing their own counter-attack.<span> <a href="https://edu.jcbfshr.com/history/passchendaele/">Read more...</a></span>
