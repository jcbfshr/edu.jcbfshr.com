          <title>Compare how the writers convey their different attitudes to the two schools</title>

          <description>In both sources, the surroundings are abysmal, yet the staff share very different attitudes to the school. In Source A, Sister Brendan is eager to show off her fantastic pupils to the inspector, whereas in Source B, the writer dreads school. The writer in Source A shows Sister Brendan’s zeal in the way she moves: she “glided through the school”. The onomatopoeic verb “glide” shows that the writer picks up on how at ease she feels around the children, and how she feels comfortable among them, like a blade of grass in a field.</description>

          <title>How does the writer use language to describe Sister Brendan?</title>

          <description>The writer immediately plants doubts about Sister Brendan, using the simile “small hungry blackbird”. The adjective “hungry” is extended to “out for the early worm”, which suggests Phinn sees the headmistress as an eager and dominant figure. Yet this is juxtaposed against the semantic field describing her physique — “tiny”, “little”, “small”, perhaps reminding the reader that he is not dominated by the Sister; that he is the inspector. The writer continues this repetition of contrasting the Sister’s ardent speech with negative imagery immediately after: in the shaking of the hands, hers are described as “cold”, and her eyes “look up” into his after the Sister asking about the writer’s journey.</description>

          <title>Evaluate the environmental impact of extraction of raw materials in Nigeria</title>
          <link>https://edu.jcbfshr.com/geography/nigeria-raw-materials-extraction/</link>

          <description>(revisions in bold) Oil extraction can lead to oil spills which are highly damaging to local ecosystems, such as the Bodo oil spills between 2008-2009. Because of the hugely dense deposit of oil (11 million gallons across 20km²), it will take at least 30 years for the area’s ecosystem to regenerate.
The damage can be amplified in undersea oil pipelines and offshore oil pumps as special diving equipment or specialised for bigger oil spills, which take a long time to deploy and, therefore, to fix the oil spill.</description>

          <title>Reducing the North-South divide</title>
          <link>https://edu.jcbfshr.com/geography/north-south-divide/</link>

          <guid>https://edu.jcbfshr.com/geography/north-south-divide/</guid>
          <description>(revisions in bold) The North-South divide is stark, yet the line seems impalpable to most everyone. Part of the reason for this is that the changes between the “north” and the “south” occur gradually — despite many trying to clearly define a line similar to Hadrian’s Wall. For example, around ¼ of people living in the Midlands say they consider themselves Northern, and only around 7.5% saying they consider themselves Southern.</description>

          <description>In 2017, Theresa May’s government announced plans to build a tunnel, at least 3.2km long, underneath Stonehenge, but 50m further away from the monument, although the first mention of a tunnel under Stonehenge came in 1995. This plan is a result of the £15 billion road improvement plan that Cameron’s government announced in 2014, under which the A303 was flagged requiring improvements. Prime Minister David Cameron said the road “held parts of the country back”.</description>

          <title>Summary of the differences between the behaviour of the children at the two schools</title>
          <link>https://edu.jcbfshr.com/english/language/p2/q2/</link>

          <description>In Source A, the attitudes to education are open, with a lot of emphasis on creativity. This can be inferred from the fact that “children’s painting[s] and poems […] covered every available space”, suggesting that the school embraced the children’s creativity. However, in the second source, the teacher remarks the schoolgirls are “boxing most viciously”, showing that the school is a place of violence rather than education.
In the first source, the the children are described as “bright-eyed and keen”.</description>

          <description>q. i) Write an account of how the Battle of Verdun became a crisis for both sides during 1916 (8 marks)
The Battle of Verdun became a crisis for the French as they had lost Fort Douaumont and their defensive positions at the start of the battle. Because it was seen as “the most well-defended city in France”, the French were reluctant to give it up, despite it having no major, strategic position.</description>

          <title>Simon&#39;s significance in Golding&#39;s Lord of The Flies</title>
          <link>https://edu.jcbfshr.com/english/literature/lotf/simon/</link>

          <description>Simon is, perhaps, the only character in the novel to symbolise Golding’s piety following the horrors he faced during his time serving in the British Navy. Monteith cut almost references and symbolism of religion out of the original draft, being an agnostic himself. In the beginning of the book, Simon reaches up into the trees to feed the desperate littluns' hands below, ensuring they get “double handfuls”. Simon is, in this passage, physically higher than the greedy littluns, almost suggesting he is metaphorically higher, too.</description>

          <description>The Germans had not launched a major offensive on the Western Front since November 1914. Thus enter Verdun: the longest, and amongst the bloodiest of The First World War, which ultimately saw Germany’s own plan massively backfire, whilst the Russian war machine was now in full swing, the British and French began an offensive at the Somme (involving the first ever use of tanks), and the Romanians (following two years of neutrality) sided with the Triple Entente.</description>

          <description>Notes  Haig’s goal was to break out of the positions at Ypres, overlooked by the Germans — pushing towards the Belgian coast (where some U-Boat stations were) and draw them away from the suffering French army  British did control most of the high ground by the end of the battle French army had used its crucial opportunity to recover   Haig gave command to Gough (who had risen from commanding a brigade to the 5th Army in two years) instead of Plumer, who had successfully launched an offensive at Messines Ridge just before Passchendaele using a bite-and-hold approach  25 August 1917 — Haig gives command to Plumer   Commenced 31 July 1917 at 03:50 Gough changed the plans so that forces would attempt to capture the third and fourth German defensive lines, as opposed to the original plan to take two lines Almost equal amount of staggering casualties on both sides  Germans suffer 250,000 Allied suffer 260,000 “Blindest battle of a blind war”    Allied strengths at Passchendaele  Drew German forces away from French forces that could have been wiped out of the war given their near-munity on the Nivelle Offensive Heavy casualties ****— but not nearly as many as at the Somme; captured much more territory than at the Somme — shows evidence of learning curve Supported by creeping barrage because of advancements in artillery technology — evidence of continuation of learning curve since Vimy Ridge Plumer successfully introduced bite-and-hold tactics on 20 September 1917 at the Battle of Menin Road over a few hours, wading off the German counter-attacks  Soldiers would advance a very short distance (around 1500m) supported by heavy artillery, would then dig in and repel German counter-attacks, without becoming spread too thin (which accounted for the success of the German defence in depth tactics) Unlike Gough, he took weeks to prepare and asked for many guns in advance Australians, New Zealanders and Britons successfully attack German strongpoint on 26 September 1917 at Battle of Polygon Wood, and were waiting for Germans when they tried to counter-attack  This shows that Plumer had successfully turned the Germans' own defence in depth tactic against them     Bite-and-hold tactics yet again deployed with a surprise attack at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917 whilst the Germans were preparing their own counter-attack.</description>
