          <description>Simon is, perhaps, the only character in the novel to symbolise Golding’s piety following the horrors he faced during his time serving in the British Navy. Monteith cut almost references and symbolism of religion out of the original draft, being an agnostic himself. In the beginning of the book, Simon reaches up into the trees to feed the desperate littluns' hands below, ensuring they get “double handfuls”. Simon is, in this passage, physically higher than the greedy littluns, almost suggesting he is metaphorically higher, too.</description>

          <description>The Germans had not launched a major offensive on the Western Front since November 1914. Thus enter Verdun: the longest, and amongst the bloodiest of The First World War, which ultimately saw Germany’s own plan massively backfire, whilst the Russian war machine was now in full swing, the British and French began an offensive at the Somme (involving the first ever use of tanks), and the Romanians (following two years of neutrality) sided with the Triple Entente.</description>
