<p><em>(NB: applying for French, English Literature, Physics and Economics)</em>
When I first read Bradbury&rsquo;s Fahrenheit 451, I was reminded for my love for the English language. I found that the way in which the protagonist finds himself burning books in a regime that has capitalised on a culture with an increasingly short attention spans was incredibly apt today. As a result of people&rsquo;s short attention spans, books fell out of favour and were gradually replaced by the &ldquo;parlour&rdquo;: a room whereby the rooms are plastered with television screens. In today&rsquo;s world, there are companies advertising services which summarise a book&rsquo;s &ldquo;key points&rdquo; in under 10 minutes, but isn&rsquo;t the joy of reading in inferring our own meanings of the work in the subtleties of the metaphors scattered through a book, something a summary will never provide? This, I feel, was ultimately Bradbury&rsquo;s point, that the art of expression was lost in a world of short attention spans, where even people spoke in broken, monosyllabic speech.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the editor-in-chief of my school&rsquo;s, now student-run, newspaper — my English teacher left me to continue on in his place when he left the English department, a journalist himself. Since first joining the journal in Year 9, I&rsquo;ve gleaned a wide array of skills, from critical thinking to effective communication, and from leading a team to becoming incredibly efficient in time-management. During the pandemic, I&rsquo;ve radically changed the newspaper&rsquo;s outlook to become more academic; more akin to a forum for all students to voice their opinions on any subject, such as &ldquo;are humans ruining the Earth?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I enjoy doing charity work; for two years before the pandemic, I volunteered to set up and run the Pilgrims Hospice Elham Christmas Market. Therein, I gained valuable skills such as organisation and money-handling, a comment on my trustworthiness. I have been also been working for Barnardo&rsquo;s since the months leading to the national lockdown.</p>
<p>I look forward to the depth that A-Level study offers and being able to sink time into subjects I truly enjoy. I spend a lot of my time trying to improve my French, by listening to French radio, such as France Culture and the «Le masque et la plume» show on France Inter, which helps me to pick up the idiosyncrasies of the language and idiomatic French. I also watch French TV, which helps me to link body language to expressions. I also take every opportunity to speak French with people, for example, I have a French penpal — I help her with English and she helps likewise with French. I have a real admiration for French culture and it&rsquo;s diverse and ever-changing history.</p>
<p>I would one day hope to study Law at university, with the prospect of becoming a barrister. I love analysing small details and questioning the very basis of what is taken for granted.</p>
