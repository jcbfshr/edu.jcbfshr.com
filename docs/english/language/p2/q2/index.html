                <p>In Source A, the attitudes to education are open, with a lot of emphasis on creativity. This can be inferred from the fact that &ldquo;children&rsquo;s painting[s] and poems [&hellip;] covered every available space&rdquo;, suggesting that the school embraced the children&rsquo;s creativity. However, in the second source, the teacher remarks the schoolgirls are &ldquo;boxing most viciously&rdquo;, showing that the school is a place of violence rather than education.</p>
<p>In the first source, the the children are described as &ldquo;bright-eyed and keen&rdquo;. This emphasises that the children want to learn and enjoy the process. Whereas, in Source B, the children in the school are &ldquo;ready for anything but work&rdquo;, giving the impression that they don&rsquo;t want to be at school, nor do they want to work.</p>
<p>The primary school&rsquo;s headmistress &ldquo;boasted&rdquo; about the children&rsquo;s abilities, showing her deep faith in them. In contrast, in Source B, the teacher has &ldquo;half-a-dozen at least&rdquo; stones thrown at her, and a boy in ready with a &ldquo;brick in his hand, to have his revenge&rdquo;. The children &ldquo;have ever considered themselves at war&rdquo; with the teachers, showing that the teacher has to dodge the violence towards her.</p>
<p>Despite both school&rsquo;s having industrial settings, the Phinn writes that &ldquo;from the grime and dust, I walked into an oasis&rdquo;, showing the contrasts between the surroundings and a place of education. In the ragged school, the narrator remarks that &ldquo;no school can be possibly worst than this&rdquo;. The lanes into school are a &ldquo;moral hell&rdquo;, and this attitude practically extends into the school as well.</p>
