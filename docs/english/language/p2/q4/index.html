                <p>In both sources, the surroundings are abysmal, yet the staff share very different attitudes to the school. In Source A, Sister Brendan is eager to show off her fantastic pupils to the inspector, whereas in Source B, the writer dreads school. The writer in Source A shows Sister Brendan&rsquo;s zeal in the way she moves: she &ldquo;glided through the school&rdquo;. The onomatopoeic verb &ldquo;glide&rdquo; shows that the writer picks up on how at ease she feels around the children, and how she feels comfortable among them, like a blade of grass in a field. In contrast, in Source B, the writer&rsquo;s first mention of children is concerned with being at war with them, and thereafter the punishment of them. The hyperbolic, nominal phrase &ldquo;at war&rdquo; show&rsquo;s the vehemence of the writer&rsquo;s standpoint, that their job is not one of teaching and inspiring — as in Source A — but rather to subdue the opposition — the pupils. Therefore, although the writer probably intended to use it emphatically, the reader may conclude, rather ironically, that the pupils are at war with the teachers.</p>
<p>In Source A, the school is a place where children go to learn, with the headteacher stating that failing to teach a child to read is to metaphorically &ldquo;handicap the child&rdquo;. The idea that disability can be not only physical, but also intellectual is recognised by the school, and thus pupils would not come out of the school disabled. Whereas in Source B, the children go to school and come out disabled: &ldquo;her nose bled profusely&rdquo;. Noting the use of emotive language in the adverb &ldquo;profusely&rdquo;, the writer is asserting that their workplace is far removed from an educational setting. The writer&rsquo;s opinion that &ldquo;human beings resident in this city could so behave&rdquo;, suggests that their viewpoint on human capability has changed.</p>
<p>In Source A, there is a shift in focus from the smiley headteacher against the grim surroundings to the success of the pupils and how the writer&rsquo;s perspective has changed upon hearing the children read. Phinn describes the children with assonance — &ldquo;philosophers in ones so young&rdquo;, which could show that Phinn&rsquo;s point is that the geography doesn&rsquo;t play a part in the success of children, as his initial description of their grim surroundings might deceive an assumptive reader. In Source B, the writer shifts the focus from her negative surroundings and abusive children to her undying motivation to teach and look after the poorest children, listing off her intentions, including seeing them &ldquo;well washed&rdquo;. This alliteration underscores her motherly role to the children, despite her job being to teach. Perhaps the fact that this is listed as the &ldquo;first&rdquo; priority shows that she sees teaching as a profession whereby, more than education, the pupils are cared for, regardless of circumstances, and come out of the school knowing more about compassion than arithmetic.</p>
