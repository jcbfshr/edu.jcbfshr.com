                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>The writer immediately plants doubts about Sister Brendan, using the simile &ldquo;small hungry blackbird&rdquo;. The adjective &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; is extended to &ldquo;out for the early worm&rdquo;, which suggests Phinn sees the headmistress as an eager and dominant figure. Yet this is juxtaposed against the semantic field describing her physique — &ldquo;tiny&rdquo;, &ldquo;little&rdquo;, &ldquo;small&rdquo;, perhaps reminding the reader that he is not dominated by the Sister; that he is the inspector. The writer continues this repetition of contrasting the Sister&rsquo;s ardent speech with negative imagery immediately after: in the shaking of the hands, hers are described as &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, and her eyes &ldquo;look up&rdquo; into his after the Sister asking about the writer&rsquo;s journey. The former almost shows to the reader that Sister Brendan is souless; without life — they are cold, suggesting that the writer is trying to see past her enthusiam. The latter example is yet another subtle reminder that she is smaller than him, trying to persuade the reader of the hierarchy in this passage.</p>
<p>Sister Brendan&rsquo;s eyes are described as &ldquo;black&rdquo; and &ldquo;glittering&rdquo;. This creates the image of anthracite in the reader&rsquo;s mind, reinforcing her high-energy state. Her black eyes also links to the blackbird simile, and this simile is extended in the zoomorphism of her &ldquo;fluttering along the corridors&rdquo;, which could be a statement of how abnormal, or even inhuman the inspector finds the headteacher. Perhaps the writer is not using these devices to express his negative views about Sister Brendan, but instead to show the reader that she was so invested and eager in her job, to describe her as human would be an injustice to her efforts. Sister Brendan herself then zoomorphises herself in calling herself the &ldquo;Queen Bee&rdquo;, showing that even she sees bees as more just descriptors of herself, or it could be a statement on her wit by the inspector.</p>
