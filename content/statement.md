# Personal statement
One of my greatest passions is reading and the English language. I love reading, watching and analysing Shakespeare; I enjoy finding the subtler, complex messages behind the plays, and how almost all of what can be inferred is still remarkably relevant in today's society, and you can draw parallel's between almost every piece of drama and fiction written thereafter. I've recently began reading many classics — I've just finished reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. I found that the way in which the protagonist, Montag, finds himself burning books in a regime that has capitalised on a culture with an increasingly short attention spans was incredibly apt today. As a result of people's short attention spans, books fell out of favour and were gradually replaced by the "parlour": a room whereby the rooms are plastered with television screens. In today's world, there are companies advertising servies which summarise a book's "key points" in under 10 minutes.

I'm the editor-in-chief of my school's magazine, after my English teacher left me to continue on in his place, a journalist himself. Since first joining the department in Year 9, I've gleaned a wide array of skills, from critical thinking to the importance of unambiguous, communication, and from leading a team to incredibly efficient time-management. Even now, 2 years into the role, I'm still learning valuable skills: in the midst of a pandemic, I've shown adoptability in moving all of our operations online, creating a website and server management etc.

I enjoy doing charity work, for two years before the pandemic, I volunteered to set up and run the Pilgrims Hospice Elham Christmas Market, which I was delighted to hear raised just under £3,000 in 2019. Therein, I gained valuable skills such as organisation and money-handling, thereby demonstrating trustworthiness. I also worked for two months in a charity shop at Barnardo's, Ashford, before it closed down because of the national lockdown.
