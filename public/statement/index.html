<p>One of my greatest passions is reading and the English language. I love reading, watching and analysing Shakespeare; I enjoy finding the subtler, complex messages behind the plays, and how almost all of what can be inferred is still remarkably relevant in today&rsquo;s society, and you can draw parallel&rsquo;s between almost every piece of drama and fiction written thereafter. I&rsquo;ve recently began reading many classics — I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Ray Bradbury&rsquo;s Fahrenheit 451. I found that the way in which the protagonist, Montag, finds himself burning books in a regime that has capitalised on a culture with an increasingly short attention spans was incredibly apt today. As a result of people&rsquo;s short attention spans, books fell out of favour and were gradually replaced by the &ldquo;parlour&rdquo;: a room whereby the rooms are plastered with television screens. In today&rsquo;s world, there are companies advertising servies which summarise a book&rsquo;s &ldquo;key points&rdquo; in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the editor-in-chief of my school&rsquo;s magazine, after my English teacher left me to continue on in his place, a journalist himself. Since first joining the department in Year 9, I&rsquo;ve gleaned a wide array of skills, from critical thinking to the importance of unambiguous, communication, and from leading a team to incredibly efficient time-management. Even now, 2 years into the role, I&rsquo;m still learning valuable skills: in the midst of a pandemic, I&rsquo;ve shown adoptability in moving all of our operations online, creating a website and server management etc.</p>
<p>I enjoy doing charity work, for two years before the pandemic, I volunteered to set up and run the Pilgrims Hospice Elham Christmas Market, which I was delighted to hear raised just under £3,000 in 2019. Therein, I gained valuable skills such as organisation and money-handling, thereby demonstrating trustworthiness. I also worked for two months in a charity shop at Barnardo&rsquo;s, Ashford, before it closed down because of the national lockdown.</p>
